# Azure Lab Services within Microsoft Teams

Azure Lab Services owners/creators are now able to create labs within Microsoft Teams.

This article outlines the benefits of Teams integration and provides links to other articles for instructions on how to manage the Azure Lab Services within Teams. 

## Benefits

Azure Lab Services integration with Microsoft Teams will help educators set up a classroom environment and provide virtual lab environments within the team(class): 

* Educators can set up classroom labs so the students can access their VMs from within Teams, without leaving Teams and having to navigate to the [Azure Lab Services website](https://labs.azure.com).
* Single Sign-on (SSO) from Teams to Azure Lab Services.
* Team and Lab owners need not maintain class rosters in two different systems - Lab user list is autopopulated from the Team membership and a sync is performed every 24 hours automatically. 
* After the initial publish of the Template VM, Lab Capacity (that is, number of VMs in the lab) would be automatically adjusted based on the addition/deletion of users from the Team membership. 
* Team and Lab Owners will view only the labs related to the team and students will view only the VMs, which are provisioned for the specific team. 
* Users will be auto registered to the lab and VMs will be automatically assigned upon the first login after the lab is published. Educators don't need to send invitations and students don't need to register for the lab separately.
